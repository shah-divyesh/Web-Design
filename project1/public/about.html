                <h2 class="main__title">Let's get to know about rabbits!!!</h2>
                <p class="main__paragraph">
                     Rabbits belong to the family Leporidae and are believed to have originated in Europe around 34-56 million years ago. 
                     The European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) is the species most domesticated for pets and agriculture.
                     Rabbits were first domesticated by the Romans over 2,000 years ago for their fur and meat.
                     They later spread to other parts of Europe and eventually reached North America through European colonization.
                </p>

                <p class="main__paragraph">
                    Rabbits have played various roles in different cultures. In ancient Egypt, they were associated with fertility and rebirth due to their prolific breeding.
                    In folklore, rabbits often appear as trickster figures, like Br'er Rabbit in African American folklore and the White Rabbit in Lewis Carroll's "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland."
                    During the Middle Ages, rabbits were raised in Europe for their meat and fur. They were introduced to Australia in the 18th century, where they became a significant pest due to their rapid breeding. 
                    In contrast, Angora rabbits were selectively bred in Turkey for their soft and luxurious wool.
                </p>  

                <p class="main__paragraph"> 
                    Rabbits have been used extensively in scientific research, particularly in studies related to genetics, immunology, and toxicology. 
                    Their relatively large size and ease of breeding make them valuable research subjects.
                    The domestic rabbit has been selectively bred into various breeds with different characteristics, such as size, coat type, and color. 
                    Some popular breeds include the Holland Lop, Netherland Dwarf, and Flemish Giant.
                </p>

                <p class="main__paragraph"> 
                    In summary, the history of rabbits is a rich tapestry of their evolution, domestication, cultural significance, economic importance, conservation challenges, and contributions to scientific research. 
                    These small mammals have left their paw prints on both natural ecosystems and human culture throughout history. 
                    I hope you become more aware about rabbit and soread awareness.
